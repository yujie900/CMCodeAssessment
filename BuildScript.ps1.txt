#Hi Justin/Jeffery, from what I learned PSake uses a dependency mechanism to define tasks that depends on other tasks. 
#For example everytime before we rebuild a solution we need to clean it.
   
            
task -name Build -description "builds outdated source files" -action {            
    write-host 'The build task is now running';            
    exec {            
        msbuild 'C:\Users\Yujie\Desktop\CMCodeAssessment\FizzBuzz\FizzBuzz.sln' /p:Configuration=$config            
    }            
}            
            
task -name Clean -description "deletes all build artifacts" -action {            
    write-host 'The clean task is now running';             
     exec {            
        msbuild 'C:\Users\Yujie\Desktop\CMCodeAssessment\FizzBuzz\FizzBuzz.sln' /t:Clean /p:Configuration=$config             
    }            
}            
            
task -name Rebuild -depends Clean,Build -action {            
    write-host 'The rebuild task is now running';             
}
            
#here's the task to run nunit test            
Task -nunitTest {
    Exec { C:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit 2.6\bin\nunit-console.exe FizzBuzz\FizzBuzz\bin\debug\FizzBuzz.dll" }
}
task default -depends Build;
